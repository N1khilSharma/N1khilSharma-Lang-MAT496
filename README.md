What I learned - 
1) Tracing implementation, application and usage.
2) Run tree tracing, checking latency and checking metadata.
3) Metadata addition during and before runtime

Changes I made -
1) Changed the prompts for questions asked to rag to better understand the trace difference and token difference before and after
2) Added a code at the end to test rag and metadata addition at runtime.
