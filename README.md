**MODULE 1**

Video - 1
What I learned - 
1) Tracing implementation, application and usage.
2) Run tree tracing, checking latency and checking metadata.
3) Metadata addition during and before runtime

Changes I made -
1) Changed the prompts for questions asked to rag to better understand the trace difference and token difference before and after
2) Added a code at the end to test rag and metadata addition at runtime.

Video - 2
What I learned - 
1) Types of runs supported by langsmith in @Traceable decorator
2) Different traces for different types of runs and their comparisons and rendering
3) Formatting affects on the Tracing outputs.

Changes I made -
1)Added a code at the end that includes every type of runs to trace all the run trees.
2)Altered the prompt questions to see if any difference would occur in the tracing.
