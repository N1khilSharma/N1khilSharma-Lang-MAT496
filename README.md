**MODULE 1**

**Video - 1**
What I learned -

1) Tracing implementation, application and usage.
2) Run tree tracing, checking latency and checking metadata.
3) Metadata addition during and before runtime

Changes I made -

1) Changed the prompts for questions asked to rag to better understand the trace difference and token difference before and after
2) Added a code at the end to test rag and metadata addition at runtime.

**Video - 2**
What I learned - 

1) Types of runs supported by langsmith in @Traceable decorator
2) Different traces for different types of runs and their comparisons and rendering
3) Formatting affects on the Tracing outputs.

Changes I made -

1)Added a code at the end that includes every type of runs to trace all the run trees.

2)Altered the prompt questions to see if any difference would occur in the tracing.

**Video - 3**
What I learned - 

1) Checking Traces created by langgraph and the nodes created
   
2) Using python tracing content manager trace() for more granular control
   
3) Formatting affects on the Tracing outputs.

Changes I made -

1)Changed run types to check if traces would be different while tracing inside a function.

2)Altered a few prompt questions to see if any difference would occur in the tracing.

3)Added my own example with both python's tracing content manager and Langchain's @Traceable decorator
